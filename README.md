# Improving the Order-to-Cash (O2C) Process for an Online Retail Store

## Overview
This project analyzes the Order-to-Cash process of a fictional online retail company, identifies inefficiencies, and proposes improvements to optimize operations. The project demonstrates skills in business process modeling, KPI design, and operational insights.

## Business Problem
The company experiences delays in order fulfilment, recurring invoicing errors, and inconsistent payment tracking. These issues lead to dissatisfied customers, delayed revenue collection, and inefficient workflows.

## Approach
1. Mapped the **AS-IS process** (current manual workflow, multiple handoffs).  
2. Identified pain points and inefficiencies.  
3. Designed a **TO-BE process** with automation and streamlined approvals.  
4. Defined **KPIs** to measure process improvements.  
5. Presented **insights and recommendations** to create business value.
